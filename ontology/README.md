# Ontology Implementation

This folder contains the **implementation files of the ontology**, representing the formal and machine-readable definition of the knowledge model.

# Purpose
The goal of this directory is to store the **final ontology artifacts**, which describe the classes, properties, relationships, and constraints defined during the conceptualization phase.

These files are typically used for:
- Semantic reasoning and inference  
- Data integration and interoperability  
- Knowledge graph construction  
- Publishing the ontology for reuse

# Contents
Include here any files that represent the implemented ontology, such as:

- `.owl` — Ontology Web Language files  
- `.rdf` — Resource Description Framework files  
- `.ttl` — Turtle serialization of RDF  
- `.jsonld` — JSON for Linked Data  

# Best Practices
- Keep ontology versions clearly labeled and documented.  
- Validate ontology syntax and semantics before committing changes.  
- Maintain consistency with the conceptual diagrams and documentation stored in the **conceptualization** folder.  
- Use a standardized namespace and prefix strategy.

# Notes
- This folder should contain only **implementation files** — not diagrams, notes, or documentation.  
- Consider adding a changelog or version history file if multiple ontology versions are maintained.
