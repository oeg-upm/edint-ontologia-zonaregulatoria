# KOS Implementation

This folder contains the **implementation files of controlled vocabulary or KOS**, representing the formal and machine-readable definition of needed vocabularies.

# Purpose
The goal of this directory is to store the **vocabulary or KOS files**, which describe the concepts and relations among them.



# Contents
Include here any files that represent the implemented ontology, such as:

- `.owl` — Ontology Web Language files  
- `.rdf` — Resource Description Framework files  
- `.ttl` — Turtle serialization of RDF  
- `.jsonld` — JSON for Linked Data  

# Best Practices
- Keep vocabulary or KOS versions clearly labeled and documented.  
- Validate the syntax and semantics before committing changes.  
- Maintain consistency with the conceptual diagrams and documentation stored in the **conceptualization** folder, if applicable.  
- Use a standardized namespace and prefix strategy.

# Notes
- This folder should contain only **implementation files** — not diagrams, notes, or documentation.  
- Consider adding a changelog or version history file if multiple ontology versions are maintained.
