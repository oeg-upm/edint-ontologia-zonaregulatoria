# Ontology Conceptualization Resources

This folder contains all the **resources related to the conceptualization and design phase** of the ontology.

#  Purpose
The goal of this directory is to store **visual and structural materials** that support the understanding and definition of the ontology’s concepts, relationships, and structure **of their formal implementation** (e.g., in OWL or RDF).

# Contents
Include here any files that represent or support the ontology’s conceptual model, such as:

- **Diagrams** illustrating classes, relationships, or hierarchies  

# Accepted Formats
Please store resources in one of the following formats:
- `.svg` — Scalable vector graphics  
- `.png` — Image snapshots of diagrams  
- `.drawio` — Editable diagrams created with [diagrams.net (draw.io)](https://app.diagrams.net/)  

Other formats (e.g., `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.pptx`) can be included if relevant for conceptual discussions.

# Notes
- Keep versions of diagrams when major conceptual changes occur.  
- This folder does **not** contain ontology code or OWL/RDF files — those belong in the implementation folder.  
- Ensure all diagrams are consistent with the latest ontology specifications.
