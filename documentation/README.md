# Ontology documentation

This folder contains all the **human oriented documentation**.  


# Purpose
The goal of this directory is to store **human oriented documentation of the ontology** to be published online and facilitate the understanding of the conceptualization and its use by third parties. 

This documentation eases the **reuse, and maintainability** of the ontology.

# Contents
Include here any files  used to publish the ontology, such as:

- **HTML files** — Generated by [Widoco](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco). This files might include also examples, SPARQL queries, links to SHACL shapes, etc.


# Accepted Formats
You can use formats such as:
- `.html` — HTML files  
- `.md`, `.pdf` — Reports or documentation of test outcomes  
- additional files needed for HMTL content.

# Best Practices
- Keep documentation files **versioned** alongside ontology updates.
